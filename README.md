#AIO
AIO is a pure lua server-client communication system for Eluna and WoW.  
It is designed for sending lua addons and data to player from server and from player to server.  
Made for Eluna Lua engine: https://github.com/ElunaLuaEngine/Eluna  
Tested on 3.3.5a and should work on other patches. Works with Lua 5.1 and 5.2.

- For installation see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
- For API documentation see the Examples folder and the source files' comments
- See configuration settings on AIO.lua file, you can tweak both the server and client file separately
